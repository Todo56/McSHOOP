# McpeSHOOP

## What is it?
McpeSHOOP is an online Minecraft shop for servers similar to Tebex, on which you can sell ranks, perks and anything that can be done with a command on-line. It is lightweight, runs using PHP 7.0 minimum and uses MySQL to store the information. It runs using the paypal API. 

## Why use McpeSHOOP?
McpeSHOOP is self hosted and opensource thus it is free and only requires a hosting provider that supports PHP. Even though it doesn't have as many features as tebex, it can do the work, and it can do it for free, without monthly payments. It is not so easy to setup but you can always join our discord server if you have any questions and it only requires a paypal business account in order to run. It also uses rcon instead of a custom plugin so all the commands are executed instantly without having to wait until it refreshes.
