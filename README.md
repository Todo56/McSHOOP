# McpeSHOOP
## What is it?
McpeSHOOP is an online Minecraft shop for servers similar to Tebex, on which you can sell ranks, perks and anything that can be done with a command on-line. It is lightweight, runs using PHP 7.0 minimum and uses MySQL to store the information. It runs using the paypal API. 

## Features:
- Logging system for purchases.
- Custom commands for purchases.
- Message Broadcaster.
- Categories for products.

## Technologies Used:
- PHP 7.4
- MySQL 8
- PayPal API v2

## Why use McpeSHOOP?
McpeSHOOP is self hosted and opensource thus it is free and only requires a hosting provider that supports PHP. Even though it doesn't have as many features as tebex, it can do the work, and it can do it for free, without monthly payments. It is not so easy to setup but you can always join our discord server if you have any questions and it only requires a paypal business account in order to run. It also uses rcon instead of a custom plugin so all the commands are executed instantly without having to wait until it refreshes.

## Setting it up:
1. First of all please make sure that you have PHP 7.2 at least installed and MySQL 8.
2. Create a paypal application and put your credentials on the config.php file.
3. Execute the queries in config.sql
4. Configure your application in the config.php (domain and other settings).
5. Download our plugin for a better experience and install it into your Minecraft Server.
6. Try purchasing an article on ___**SANDBOX**___ mode or live mode if you wish.
7. If everything has worked fine you should be able to enjoy McpeSHOOP in your server. If an error pops out however, feel free to join our Discord Server!
